# Open Sessions
This repository contains all the notebooks that were used in the Open Sessions organized by [fuse|ai](https://fuse.ai).
Our sessions were structured so that any newcomer with little to no programming experience would be able to understand how and why Machine Learning is used to solve problems in various sectors. Currently, the sessions have covered the following topics in order:
1. Python basics, Object-Oriented Programming foundations, NumPy
2. Data Manipulation with Pandas and Visualization with Matplotlib
3. Regression tasks
4. Classification and Ensemble tasks
5. Unsupervised Learning
6. Deep Learning (Session on the first Saturday of March, 2019)

The notebooks and compilation of resources here are provided for anyone to use not as a comprehensive course but as a foundation for their further learning. The goal of the series has been to make the participants actively involved in the process of self-learning.
